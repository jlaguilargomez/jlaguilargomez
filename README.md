## Hi there üëã I'm Jose Luis

I became **Front End developer** after some years of **Building Engineer** career: I took the degree and a master in "Heritage Conservation" at "Polytechnic University of Madrid" and later, I was working as a construction manager in some projects.

#### Why I made the decision to change my career?
Because I am that kind of strange person who **enjoys studying and learning something new day by day**. And I love tech. 
So, thanks to my friends mainly, I discovered the world of code. 
Suddenly, an infinite world of new knowledge appeared in front of me.

#### How I became Junior Front end?
First of all, I started learning some basics at **"FreecodeCamp"** and  **"Codecademy"**. Luckily, I had the opportunity to take part in a course of "Front end development" made by "Telefonica Foundation", so that I could reinforce the base knowledge that I had and add some new skills to my "bag".

#### What I'm looking for now?
Obviously, I want to earn money doing what I love. But, furthermore, I want to grow every day: taking challenges, learn new skills, and improving my knowledge as a developer...


### Nowadays...
- üå± I'm currently learning some advance concepts of web development  such as "Performance",  "Secirity", "React+Redux", "AWS" ...   with the course **"The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap (2020)"** by  [Andrei Neagoie (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=DSA_Catchall_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_88010211481_._ad_437497337004_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-841699838623_._li_1005489_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksN6ehi0pJzjHVX03U_kxNlzHIJ8keS0s5A0tZbkWYwmmAO7kXMh_g8aAtljEALw_wcB).

# Hobbies:

I love sports: bike, running and strength workout.

If I have the opportunity, I love go hiking at mountain with friends. ¬øWeather go wrong?, is a good moment to stay home playing some board games.
